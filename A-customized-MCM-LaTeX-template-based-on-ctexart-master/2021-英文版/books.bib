	abstract = {Abstract Testing the equality of two population correlation coefficients when the data are bivariate normal and Pearson correlation coefficients are used as estimates of the population parameters is a straightforward procedure covered in many introductory statistics courses. The coefficients are converted using Fisher's z-transformation with standard errors (N − 3)−1/2. The two transformed values are then compared using a standard normal procedure. When data are not bivariate normal, Spearman's correlation coefficient rho is often used as the index of correlation. Comparison of two Spearman rhos is not as well documented. Three approaches were investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Treating the Spearman coefficients as though they were Pearson coefficients and using the standard Fisher's z-transformation and subsequent comparison was more robust with respect to Type I error than either ignoring the nonnormality and computing Pearson coefficients or converting the Spearman coefficients to Pearson equivalents prior to transformation.}

	abstract = {The main goal of this work is to introduce a theoretical model, based on cellular automata, to simulate epidemic spreading. Specifically, it divides the population into three classes: susceptible, infected and recovered, and the state of each cell stands for the portion of these classes of individuals in the cell at every step of time. The effect of population vaccination is also considered. The proposed model can serve as a basis for the development of other algorithms to simulate real epidemics based on real data.}
